# England 2-0 Finland: Kane Shines on His 100th Cap

In a thrilling Nations League clash at Wembley, England secured a 2-0 victory over Finland, with Harry Kane stealing the spotlight by scoring both goals on his 100th appearance for the national team. The night was also marked by a poignant tribute to the late Sven-Goran Eriksson, England’s former manager, making it a memorable occasion for the fans.

Kane's first goal was a breathtaking strike, rifling off the underside of the crossbar just before the 60-minute mark. He followed it up with a composed finish in the 75th minute, taking his international tally to an impressive 68 goals. The goals were not only a testament to Kane's brilliance but also served as a reminder of his continued importance to the team, despite some critics questioning his recent performances.

The match wasn't all smooth sailing for England, though. Finland's goalkeeper, Lukas Hradecky, was in exceptional form, denying Kane several times and keeping Finland in the game, especially in the first half. Kane had a goal disallowed for offside, and other English players, like Bukayo Saka and Trent Alexander-Arnold, came close to breaking the deadlock but were unable to find the back of the net.

However, Kane was determined not to let his milestone pass without impact. His persistence paid off with two well-taken goals, capping a night that he described as "perfect." Reflecting on the occasion, Kane said, "Scoring two goals and helping the team win on my 100th cap—it was a special night."

## Lee Carsley’s Impressive Start

Interim boss Lee Carsley, now with two wins from two games, has guided England to second place in Nations League Group B2, just behind Greece on goal difference. Carsley praised the team's performance, emphasizing the positive momentum as England looks ahead to upcoming fixtures.

Young talents like Angel Gomes, who made his senior debut, and Rico Lewis also impressed in the starting lineup. Gomes, in particular, showcased his composure and skill, contributing to England's fluid passing game, while Lewis remained solid at the back. Despite Finland's attempts to counter, particularly through Topi Keskinen and Teemu Pukki, England's defense held firm.

## Tribute to Sven-Goran Eriksson

Before kick-off, Wembley honored Sven-Goran Eriksson, who recently passed away. The former England manager had been a significant figure in English football, and the tribute added a heartfelt tone to the night. Eriksson's presence was felt, and the atmosphere was one of remembrance and celebration of his contributions to the game.

## Looking Ahead

England’s Nations League journey continues next month with a home match against Greece on October 10, followed by an away game in Finland. With Kane in fine form and Carsley’s leadership steadying the ship, the Three Lions look well-positioned to continue their winning run.

In a post-match interview, Carsley expressed confidence in the direction the team is heading. "We’re moving in the right direction. It’s great to see the players enjoying their football, and the results are reflecting that."

For now, though, the spotlight remains firmly on Harry Kane, who, with 68 goals in 100 games, continues to prove why he’s one of England’s greatest ever players. As he eyes the possibility of hitting 100 goals for his country, one thing is clear—Kane’s journey is far from over.
