### How we vet brands and products

Too much belly fat can increase your risk of certain chronic conditions. Drinking less alcohol, eating more protein, and lifting weights are just a few steps you can take to lose belly fat.

Having excess belly fat can negatively affect health and may contribute to several chronic conditions. One specific type of belly fat — visceral fat — is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and other conditions.

Though losing fat from this area can be difficult, there are several things you can do if you’re looking to reduce excess abdominal fat. Here are 18 effective tips to lose belly fat, backed by scientific studies.

### 1. Eat plenty of soluble fiber

Soluble fiber absorbs water and forms a gel that helps slow down food as it passes through your digestive system. Studies show that this fiber may promote weight loss by helping you feel full, so you naturally eat less. What’s more, soluble fiber may help reduce belly fat.

**Summary**: Soluble fiber may help you lose weight by increasing fullness and reducing calorie absorption. Try to include plenty of high fiber foods in your diet.

### 2. Avoid foods that contain trans fats

Trans fats are created by pumping hydrogen into unsaturated fats. These fats have been linked to inflammation, heart disease, insulin resistance, and abdominal fat gain. To help reduce belly fat, read ingredient labels carefully and avoid products that contain trans fats, often listed as "partially hydrogenated fats."

**Summary**: A high intake of trans fats has been linked to increased belly fat. Limiting your intake of trans fat is a good idea.

### 3. Moderate your alcohol intake

Alcohol can have health benefits in small amounts, but too much can be harmful. Observational studies link heavy alcohol consumption to excess fat storage around the waist. Reducing alcohol intake may help shrink your waistline.

**Summary**: Excess alcohol intake is associated with increased belly fat. Drink in moderation or consider abstaining if you're trying to lose weight.

### 4. Eat a high protein diet

Protein is crucial for weight management. High protein intake increases the release of the fullness hormone, decreases appetite, and raises your metabolic rate. Research shows that people who eat more protein tend to have less abdominal fat.

**Summary**: High protein foods like fish, lean meats, and beans can help reduce belly fat.

### 5. Reduce your stress levels

Stress can make you gain belly fat by triggering the release of cortisol, a stress hormone that promotes fat storage around the middle. To reduce belly fat, engage in stress-reducing activities such as yoga or meditation.

**Summary**: Minimizing stress should be a priority if you're trying to lose weight, as stress can increase fat storage.

### 6. Don’t eat a lot of sugary foods

Excessive sugar intake, especially in the form of fructose, is linked to several chronic diseases and increased belly fat. Limiting your sugar intake is key to reducing belly fat.

**Summary**: Sugar is a major driver of weight gain. Cut down on sugary foods and drinks to reduce belly fat.

### 7. Do aerobic exercise (cardio)

Aerobic exercise, also known as cardio, is a great way to burn calories and improve health. Studies suggest that aerobic exercise is particularly effective at reducing belly fat.

**Summary**: Aerobic exercise is effective for reducing belly fat and improving overall body composition.

### 8. Cut back on carbs — especially refined carbs

Reducing carb intake, especially refined carbs, can help reduce belly fat. You don’t need to follow a strict low-carb diet, but replacing refined carbs with healthier options, like whole grains, can be beneficial.

**Summary**: Reducing your intake of refined carbs can lead to a reduction in belly fat, especially if you replace them with whole grains or vegetables.

### 9. Perform resistance training (lift weights)

Weightlifting helps build muscle mass and can reduce abdominal fat. Combining resistance training with aerobic exercise leads to the best results for fat loss.

**Summary**: Strength training can be an effective way to reduce belly fat, especially when combined with cardio.

### 10. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages

Sugar-sweetened beverages are high in liquid sugar, which can promote belly fat gain. Limit your intake of drinks like soda, punch, and sweetened tea.

**Summary**: Liquid sugars, such as those found in sugary drinks, are a major contributor to belly fat.

### 11. Get plenty of restful sleep

Lack of sleep is associated with weight gain, including belly fat. Aim to get at least 7 hours of restful sleep per night.

**Summary**: Poor sleep quality or lack of sleep is linked to weight gain, including belly fat.

### 12. Track your food intake and exercise

Monitoring what you eat and how much you exercise can help you lose weight and reduce belly fat. Use apps or food journals to track your daily intake and activity levels.

**Summary**: Keeping track of what you eat and your physical activity is a useful strategy for losing belly fat.

### 13. Eat fatty fish every week

Fatty fish like salmon, sardines, and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fats, which can reduce visceral fat. Aim to consume 2–3 servings of fatty fish per week.

**Summary**: Eating fatty fish can help reduce abdominal fat and improve overall health.

### 14. Limit consumption of fruit juice

While fruit juice provides vitamins, it's high in sugar and can contribute to weight gain. Limit your consumption of fruit juice and opt for water or unsweetened beverages.

**Summary**: Limit fruit juice consumption, as it can be high in sugar and contribute to belly fat gain.

### 15. Add apple cider vinegar to your diet

Apple cider vinegar has been shown to reduce blood sugar levels and may promote fat loss. Consider adding 1–2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to your daily diet.

**Summary**: Consuming apple cider vinegar may aid in fat loss, including belly fat.

### 16. Eat probiotic-rich foods or take a probiotic supplement

Probiotics can improve gut health and help regulate weight. Some studies suggest that probiotics may help reduce belly fat.

**Summary**: Probiotics may help with belly fat reduction by promoting a healthy gut.

### 17. Try intermittent fasting

Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves alternating periods of eating and fasting. Some studies suggest that it can help reduce belly fat.

**Summary**: Intermittent fasting can be an effective way to reduce belly fat by promoting calorie restriction.

### 18. Drink green tea

Green tea contains caffeine and antioxidants, which can help boost metabolism and promote fat loss, especially in the abdominal area.

**Summary**: Drinking green tea can help burn belly fat, thanks to its caffeine and antioxidant content.
