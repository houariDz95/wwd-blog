# Indonesia Resumes Sea Sand Exports: A Boon or Bane for the Environment?

*September 21, 2024 - Jakarta*

After a 20-year hiatus, Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, has revived its controversial sea sand export policy. The decision, which has stirred both political and environmental debate, is now taking center stage as the country balances economic interests with ecological preservation.

Under the new policy, the government has mandated that sea sand exports can only proceed once domestic needs are fulfilled. This regulation, aligned with Government Regulation No. 26 of 2023, was signed into law by President Joko Widodo last year. Yet, its real impact hinges on revised trade policies, with Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan introducing new regulations—20/2024 and 21/2024—to define what can and cannot be exported.

According to Isy Karim, the Trade Ministry’s Director General of Foreign Trade, the policy is primarily aimed at addressing sedimentation issues. This sediment buildup, often a hazard for coastal ecosystems and marine life, is now being regulated for export to promote ecosystem restoration.

However, environmentalists are not convinced. Activists have been quick to point out that dredging and exporting marine sediment could lead to far-reaching environmental damage. While President Widodo clarified that it's "marine sediment" and not "sea sand" being exported, the lines remain blurred. On September 17, he argued that this sediment clogs shipping lanes and differs from sea sand, but critics argue that this explanation sidesteps broader ecological concerns.

## The Economic vs. Environmental Debate

Historically, Indonesia was a key supplier of sea sand to neighboring Singapore, a nation that has long been reclaiming land to expand its territory. The 2003 ban on sea sand exports was put in place due to the alarming rate of environmental degradation, which led to the erosion and disappearance of several small Indonesian islands. The fear now is that history could repeat itself.

Ihsan Ro, an economist and dean at the University of Mataram, voiced his concerns about the long-term costs associated with this policy. He argues that while the potential for non-tax revenue from exports might be attractive, the environmental costs—like habitat destruction and coastal erosion—could far outweigh any financial gains. "We need a full study to understand the real trade-offs," he said, warning against rushing into decisions that prioritize short-term gains over sustainable outcomes.

Politicians, too, are voicing opposition. Daniel Johan, a member of Indonesia's House of Representatives, echoed these concerns. In a public statement, he warned that sand extraction could severely impact marine ecosystems, reduce water quality, and destroy the habitats of countless marine species. "The damage could be irreversible," he cautioned, adding that the loss of small islands, as witnessed two decades ago, could happen again.

## A Threat to Local Communities and Fishermen

Beyond the environmental risks, the economic livelihoods of Indonesia’s coastal communities are also at stake. Greenpeace Indonesia’s marine campaigner, Afdillah, highlighted how sand mining could devastate fishing grounds, reduce local fish populations, and eventually lead to food shortages. He pointed to a 2020 incident in the Spermonde Islands, where dredging by a Dutch ship severely impacted local fishing areas. The community there is still recovering.

Afdillah also pointed out that while the government's regulation talks about licensing and mining mechanisms, there is little to no emphasis on actual environmental restoration. “The regulations are focused on facilitating exports, not repairing the damage caused by dredging,” he noted.

Former maritime affairs minister Susi Pudjiastuti also chimed in on social media, urging the government to use sand and sediment for local needs—such as combating coastal erosion in northern Java—rather than shipping it off for profit. “Why not use these resources to help our own people first?” she asked.

## A Controversial Path Forward

The government’s decision to resume sea sand exports is raising more questions than answers. While there are certainly potential economic benefits, they must be weighed against the environmental costs and the risk of further erosion to Indonesia’s fragile ecosystems.

It’s clear that both sides have valid points, but without comprehensive studies and concrete restoration plans, the future of Indonesia's coastal regions remains uncertain. For now, the debate continues, with the livelihoods of many and the preservation of marine ecosystems hanging in the balance.
