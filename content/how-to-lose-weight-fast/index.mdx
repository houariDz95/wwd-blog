# How to Lose Weight Fast, According to Experts

[Losing weight](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a) is a goal many people strive for, whether for health, confidence, or personal reasons. While the appeal of quick-fix diets can be tempting, experts emphasize the importance of taking a sustainable, long-term approach to weight loss. Rapid weight loss methods can often lead to more harm than good.

### 15 Tips for Safe and Sustainable Weight Loss

#### 1. Focus on Lifestyle Changes, Not Diets
Diets can be restrictive and lead to an unhealthy [obsession](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a) with food. Instead, Ellen Albertson, Ph.D., a registered dietitian, recommends focusing on overall health. "You can't control the number on the scale entirely, but you can control what you eat and how much you move," says Albertson.

#### 2. Aim for Small Wins
Rather than fixating on a large number, aim to lose 5% to 10% of your total body weight. Connie Bennett, a certified health coach, explains that even this modest loss can lower your risk of chronic illnesses like diabetes or heart disease.

#### 3. Cut Out Ultra-Processed Carbs and Sweets
Improving the quality of the food you eat can make a huge difference. “Cutting down on [sugary snacks](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a) and processed carbs can speed up your weight loss,” says Bennett. Swap out chips and cookies for nutrient-dense alternatives.

#### 4. Eat More Plants
A plant-based diet has been shown to promote weight loss while being easier to maintain than low-calorie diets. Dr. Albertson suggests aiming for at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily to boost your fiber intake and help you feel full.

#### 5. Increase Protein Intake
Eating more protein can help with muscle preservation and appetite control. Albertson recommends aiming for 25 to 30 grams of protein per meal. Protein helps keep you full and ensures you maintain muscle mass as you lose weight.

#### 6. Stay Hydrated
Drinking enough water plays a significant role in weight loss. Not only can it help manage cravings, but it’s also essential for fat-burning processes in the body. Celebrity trainer Jordan Morello recommends following the “eight by eight” rule: drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water throughout the day.

#### 7. Don’t Skip Breakfast
Skipping breakfast is linked to weight gain and poor diet quality. A [well-rounded breakfast](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a) that includes protein, healthy fats, and quality carbs can help stabilize your blood sugar and provide energy for the day.

#### 8. Stand and Move More
Increasing your movement throughout the day is one of the simplest ways to burn more calories. Replace sedentary activities like sitting with standing and walking to improve your daily calorie burn.

#### 9. Strength Train
Muscle burns more calories than fat, making strength training a crucial part of any weight loss plan. The more muscle you build, the higher your resting metabolic rate, allowing you to burn more calories even when resting.

#### 10. Avoid Overdoing It
It’s tempting to push yourself to the limit with calorie cutting or excessive exercise, but balance is key. Overtraining or extreme calorie deficits can lead to burnout and hinder weight loss progress. Recovery is just as important as exercise.

#### 11. Get an Accountability Partner
Having a support system can make a big difference. Studies show that having an accountability partner can help you stick to your goals and maintain weight loss over time.

#### 12. Limit TV Time
Watching too much television is linked to weight gain because it encourages sedentary behavior and mindless eating. Cutting down on TV time can help you focus more on active habits that contribute to weight loss.

#### 13. Listen to Your Body
Mindless eating can derail progress. Albertson suggests tuning into your natural hunger and fullness signals to avoid overeating. Learn to eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re satisfied rather than stuffed.

#### 14. Get Enough Sleep
Sleep plays a significant role in weight loss. Studies show that insufficient sleep is linked to [weight gain](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a) and can disrupt hunger hormones, leading to overeating.

#### 15. Find Non-Food Coping Mechanisms
Emotional eating can easily undo your hard work. When stressed, instead of reaching for comfort food, find other ways to soothe yourself—like spending time with a pet or practicing self-care.

### Why Losing Weight Fast Isn’t Ideal

The allure of rapid weight loss is strong, but it often comes at a price. When you [lose weight too quickly](https://affordspoonsgray.com/j75ssn35?key=55f12044e7cbff305d4db14598c53a3a), you risk losing muscle mass, which can slow down your metabolism. Additionally, crash diets often lead to yo-yo dieting, where the weight comes back just as fast.

In contrast, gradual weight loss is more likely to be sustainable and focused on fat loss rather than muscle loss. Taking the time to build healthy habits ensures long-term success and improves overall well-being.
