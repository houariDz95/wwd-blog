            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In recent years, U.S. news publishers have been grappling with the decline in traffic from social media. But
            while traffic from social platforms like Facebook has dwindled, something new has been quietly taking its
            place — and it’s coming from Google Discover.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Social Traffic is Down — But Discover is Rising</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If you're running a news site, you've probably noticed that traffic from social media has been decreasing.
            According to data from Chartbeat, a social analytics platform, traffic from social networks to U.S. news sites
            has dropped significantly — from 6% of total traffic in January 2023 to just 4% today. That's a one-third
            decline in just over a year.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            However, it's not all bad news. While social referrals are falling, traffic from other sources, especially
            Google Discover, is growing fast. In fact, for some publishers, Discover is driving more visitors than
            traditional Google Search.
            </p>

            <div className="relative w-full h-64 mb-6">
            <Image
                src="/blog1.jpg"
                alt="Google Discover Success"
                layout="fill"
                objectFit="cover"
                className="rounded-lg"
            />
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">What is Google Discover?</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Google Discover is a relatively new tool that delivers personalized content recommendations via the Google app
            and Chrome's mobile app. If you've ever opened a new tab on your phone and seen a collection of news articles
            and content suggestions — that’s Google Discover at work.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Unlike Google Search, Discover doesn’t require users to actively search for information. Instead, it curates
            content that aligns with a user’s interests based on their browsing behavior. And while it's still somewhat of
            a mystery how Discover selects which articles to show, publishers are starting to see it as an important
            referral source for traffic.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Hill’s Success With Discover</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The Hill, a well-known U.S. political publication, has been particularly successful with Google Discover. In
            fact, it has now overtaken Google Search as The Hill's top referral source, according to Will Federman, the VP
            of audience and content strategy at The Hill.
            </p>

            <div className="relative w-full h-64 mb-6">
            <Image
                src="/blog1.jpg"
                alt="Traffic Trends"
                layout="fill"
                objectFit="cover"
                className="rounded-lg"
            />
            </div>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Cracking the Google Discover Code</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            However, figuring out what works on Discover is still a bit of a guessing game. Google’s own guidelines for
            success on Discover are vague, leaving publishers to experiment with strategies. For example, BBC Studios is
            testing publishing at different times of the day to determine when content is most likely to perform well on
            Discover.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            One approach that has worked for The Hill is localizing national stories — that is, taking a big news story and
            finding a local angle. According to Federman, this tactic has helped them capture more Discover traffic.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Experimentation and Uncertainty</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            While some publishers are seeing positive results, Discover remains an uncertain space. “We can guess what
            might work on Discover, but we don’t pitch stories specifically for it,” said Anne Look Thiam, head of
            audience development at BBC Studios.
            </p>
                <Banner_350 />
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Brad Streicher echoed this sentiment, adding that while some patterns are emerging, Discover is still
            unpredictable. “There’s a playbook that’s starting to form, but it’s still very hazy,” he explained.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">A Changing Landscape</h2>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            In addition to Google Discover, other platforms like Reddit and news aggregator apps are beginning to drive
            more traffic, though from smaller bases. Meanwhile, traffic from Facebook has dropped by over 40% since
            January 2023.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For news publishers, the takeaway is clear: while social media referrals may be shrinking, new opportunities
            are emerging through platforms like Google Discover. By experimenting and adapting, publishers can capitalize
            on this growing source of traffic — even if it's still a bit of a mystery.
